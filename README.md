# FinVault - Intelligent FinTech Transaction Analytics Platform

> ‚ÄúA cloud-native platform to manage, analyze, and visualize financial transactions in real-time using secure, scalable, and AI-powered infrastructure.‚Äù

---

## üöÄ Project Description

**FinVault** is a full-stack FinTech application that simulates a real-world solution for financial institutions like banks, asset managers, or private equity firms to:

- Ingest high-volume transaction data (via REST or stream)
- Apply compliance validation rules and fraud detection (using ML models)
- Visualize actionable insights through dashboards and real-time alerts
- Securely scale using AWS-native cloud architecture

This project mirrors the kind of digital transformation expected at EY, focusing on regulatory compliance, cloud-native infrastructure, data observability, and full-stack architecture.

## üß© Tech Stack

### Backend
- Java 17 + Spring Boot
- AWS Lambda + API Gateway
- DynamoDB, RDS (PostgreSQL)
- AWS S3 for document storage
- RESTful APIs
- Redis (for caching & alerts)
- Apache Kafka (mocked for future real-time expansion)

### Frontend
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- Material UI or Ant Design
- React Router v6
- Chart.js / Recharts for analytics
- Axios for API integration

### DevOps / Observability
- Docker + Docker Compose
- AWS CodePipeline (CI/CD)
- AWS X-Ray, CloudWatch Logs
- Prometheus + Grafana dashboard
- Unit & integration tests using JUnit + React Testing Library

## üéì Learning Objectives

- Build and deploy cloud-native microservices using Java and AWS
- Design secure, scalable REST APIs and compliance-focused transaction workflows
- Integrate frontend with backend using token-based auth (JWT)
- Visualize large datasets with charts and anomaly overlays
- Implement observability with logs, traces, metrics

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ideal for:

- Full Stack Engineers preparing for FinTech / RegTech interviews
- Architects looking to practice AWS-native deployments
- Anyone seeking real-world experience in scalable, secure application development

## üîë Key Components

1. **User Authentication**: Secure login with JWT tokens
2. **Transaction Ingestion**: REST API for bulk upload and streaming
3. **Compliance Engine**: Rule-based checks for transaction validation
4. **Fraud Detection**: ML model scoring transactions for anomalies
5. **Dashboard & Alerts**: Real-time insights and notifications
6. **Observability**: Logs, metrics, and traces for monitoring

---
## üöú Future Enhancements

- Integrate with real AWS Kinesis stream for live transactions
- Add OCR-based document verification (e.g. KYC)
- Support multi-tenant architecture (B2B)
- Expand fraud detection with GenAI explanations

## ‚ú® Getting Started

We will define a modular project structure next with Docker-based local dev setup, code scaffolding, CI/CD instructions, and sample datasets.

Let me know when you're ready to start the project structure. ‚ö°
